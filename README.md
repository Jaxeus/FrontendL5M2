# FrontendL5M2

This Repository contains a redone version of my Level 5 Mission Two's Frontend.

My first attempt was a repository containing both Frontend and Backend, and it had a lot of superfluous folders and files.

~ The Frontend for this project was completed with React.
<br />
~ The project contains a Turners Cars homepage created by me, looking almost exactly like the Turners Cars website
(this was achieved using React with CSS modules)
<br />
~ It also includes the ability to insert an imageURL into a form, accessing the Azure Computer Vision API to return tags based on the analysis of the image through Microsoft Azure's Computer Vision software.

<h4>GETTING STARTED:</h4>

1. Create Folder in VS Code (e.g. Frontend)
2. Open Integrated Terminal from that folder
3. In terminal: git clone https://github.com/Jaxeus/FrontendL5M2.git
4. In terminal: npm install (to install node_modules)
5. In terminal: npm start (to run the React app)
